1.SOA can be hard to debug and tune because every service is making many calls to other services so 
  difficult to figure out which one is causing the issue.

2.Among Design, Developement,Testing and Maintainance.Maintainance takes the most resourses in software engineering.

3.Verification - Did you build the thing right ?
  - Did you meet the specification ?
  Validation - Did you build the right thing ?
  - Is this what the customer wants ? 
  -Is the specification correct ?
-Hardware focus generally Verification
-Software focus generally Validation

4.Tseting : 

 a.Unit Test : Single method does what was expected.
 b.Module or functional test : across individual units
 c.Integration test : interfaces between units have consistent assumptions, communicate
                      correctly.
 d.System or acceptance test: integrated program meets its specifications.
 e. Coverage : % of code paths tested
 f. Regression Testing: automatically rerun old tests so changes don't break what used to work.
 g. Continuous Integration Testing: continuous regression testing vs later phases





























 Met new scalability and real-time requirements by migrating the software stack to a new platform utilising a service-oriented architecture by architecting software, and designing algorithms/APIs using SOME-IP and DDS.
 Reduced the software download time by 98% by introducing Diagnostics-over-IP (DoIP) which involved gathering stakeholder requirements, authoring software specifications, and running unit/integration/end-to-end tests.
